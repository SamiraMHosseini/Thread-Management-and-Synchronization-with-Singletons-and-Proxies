# Thread Management and Synchronization with Singletons and Proxy




The Proxy class in the provided code serves as a simple RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) mechanism 
to increment and decrement the thread counter in the ThrdCounter singleton. 
It does this by calling ThrdCounter::TCUP() in its constructor and ThrdCounter::TCDown() in its destructor.

When an instance of the Proxy class is created in the scope of a thread function 
(e.g., within the operator() method of classes A, B, C, and D), 
it increments the thread counter by calling ThrdCounter::TCUP(). 
When the scope ends and the Proxy instance is destroyed, its destructor automatically calls ThrdCounter::TCDown() to decrement the thread counter.
This ensures that the thread counter is correctly updated as threads start and finish their tasks.

The main purpose of the Proxy class in this code is to help manage the lifetime of threads and ensure that
the ThrdCounter singleton keeps an accurate count of active threads.
